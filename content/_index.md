# 🙋🏻‍♂️ Halloen

I'm Thomas, and I really like Radio and Broadcast automation systems..

🚴 For some reason I'm into bikes(!) [Omafiets](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/omafiets) in particular. Don't ask why.

I rarely write and post, but will do my best😊
Topics that may appear here:

- Web development thoughts, ideas
- Radio automation scripts, setup
- who knows, whatever comes to mind.
